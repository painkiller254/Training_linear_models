Linear models in machine learning


Linear Regeression
----------------------
a linear model makes a prediction by simply computing a weighted sum of the input features, plus a constant called the bias term (also called the intercepterm).

Theta is the models parameter vector, containing the bias term Theta0 and the feature weights Theta1 to Thetan

x is the instance feature vector,containing x0 to xn, with x0 always equal to 1

Theta . x is the dor product of the vectors theta and x

h is the hypothesis function, using model parameters Theta
